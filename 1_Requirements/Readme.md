# Requirements
## Introduction
The heat control system is used to control the temperature of the vehicle seat. When a person gets seated on a car, the button sensor will be activated. After that, the user gets access to turn ON the heater. The temperature sensor keeps monitoring the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the analog input of the temperature sensor and outputs a temperature value through serial communication. All the activities of the control system are done on a Atmega328 microcontroller.

## Features
The System is capable of telling whether a person is seated or not.
A person once seated gets the access to turn ON the heater.
The temperature sensor keeps monitoring the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller.
## Strength
Cost effective.
Easily accessible.
High efficiency.
## Weakness
Overheating.
## Opportunities
This system can be expanded by adding few more features depending on the user requirement.
Usage of different Microcontrollers and sensors.
## Threats
Competition
## 4W's and 1H's
What - Heat control system in a vehicle
Where - Used in almost all of the passenger vehicles
When - When temperature is low
Who - To maintain body temperature of passengers
How - By using sensors and microcontroller.
